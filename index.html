My name is Muhammad Asyraif Bin Mohd Zainal but most people call me Raif as my nickname. I am 20 years old and a Diploma student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Campus Rembau Cawanagn Negeri Sembilan in  course of Information Management(IM110). I was born on 28 September 2003 in Selayang Hospital and lived and grew up in Rawang Selangor. I just have two siblings consisting of my brother and me that makes me the youngest in the family. In terms of education, I received my early education at Kemas Kindergarten, which is a kindergarten that focuses on religion education for 1 year. Then I continued as a student at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuang for 6 years from grade 1 until grade 6 and have obtained UPSR results with it 3A 2C. After that I continued my studies at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Rahman Putra from form 1 until form 5 and during my SPM I obtained quite good results which were 3A 4B 2C and qualified me to continue as a student at the diploma level at UiTM now. Lastly for my hobby that i like to do when i have a free time is i like to play badminton, football, and playing a futsal with my friend and my family.</font></p></td><td style="background-color:floralwhite" width="300" height="510" colspan="1" align="center"> <img src="images/4.jpg" width="280" height="170"> <img src="images/5.jpg" width="280" height="170"> <img src="images/6.jpg" width="280" height="170"></td></div>
